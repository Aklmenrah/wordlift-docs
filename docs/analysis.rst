Content Enrichment
_____________
To begin working with WordLift, once the plugin has been properly installed, we can simply begin writing
a blog post using the visual editor of WordPress.

WordLift adds to the visual editor of WordPress it's own menu .. image:: /images/wordpress-menu.png.

The menu has three functions:

* **Content analysis** (*cog icon*) 
* **New entity creation** (*pencil icon*)
* **WordLift graphs** 

These functions are accessible when editing blog posts or pages.

To begin analysing the content I'm writing I need to click on the *cog icon*

    This page is under development. In the meanwhile take a look at this screencast_ to get an idea of how WordLift
    works.
