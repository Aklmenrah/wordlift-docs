When should I create a new entity? 
_____________

You should create a new entity when this is directly relevant to the content you're writing and doesn't already exist. When an entity is properly recognised by WordLift you shall edit this entity rather then creating a new one. 

You can add as many entity as you like.

What are the guidelines for creating new entities to annotate a blog post or a page?
_____________

A basic guideline for adding entity is: 
	"**people should create entities that a librarian would plausibly use to classify the content you're writing as if it was a book.**"

The purpose of using WordLift is to (1) categorize your content, (2) help people find content of interest to them, and (3) help WordLift describe your contents in *machine-readable* format so that other computers can re-use it. 

In some cases key concepts that are important for (1), (2) and (3) are not automatically detected by WordLift and need to be taught. To teach WordLift new concepts a new entity shall be created.

.. note::

	When entities already exist we shall always avoid creating a new entity.

People should add entities that are accurate and directly relevant to the content they're writing, making it more likely that the content is seen by people who would be interested in it. 

A topic is directly relevant if the blog post (or page) is about the entity. If an article is not enriched with the main entity(ies) that it is about, people should add those entities.

Excessively broad entities should not be added to content. 

Content should not be overloaded with entities to increase its distribution online. As a general guideline, 8â€“16 entities should be adequate for most blog posts (based on the lenght of the article). If an article has too many entities it may be that some of the entities could be replaced with a single broader entity.

All entities shall be matched to the proper language of the content.
