Entities
_____________

An **entity** is something that exists in the real-world: celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects and works of art are all entities. For a long time, more than four decades, we teached computers to recognise things by simply matching keywords. Now computers, just like humans do, understand that a text like _[Thubten Gyatso]_ is not just made of two words but, it has a much richer meaning. 

_[Thubten Gyatso]_ is a person, more specifically he's the 13th Dalai Lama who was born in the Tsang-Ãœ province in Tibet on the 12th of February 1876. All this information - collectively shared in public sources like Wikipedia and Freebase - is organised in intelligent models known as **Graphs** that are helping computers thinking the way we do and helping us finding this information more quickly and even compute it (by providing answers to question like _Was Trinley Gyatso his predecessor?_).
