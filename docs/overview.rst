        Serendipity for bloggers

**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to create, structure and visualizing your contents.
**WordLift** helps you **adding facts**, text and media to build *beautifully structured web sites* and to 
publish your content as **`Link Linked Open Data <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_** following **Tim Berners Lee**'s 
`Link Linked Data Principles <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`**:

Facts allows WordLift to understand the text you write, structure it to create effective navigation storyboards 
and make sure *commercial search* engines like Google, Bing, Yandex and Yahoo! receive  the structured data 
they need to properly index your contents.

Why shall I publish my contents as Linked Open Data?
=================

Linked Open Data is a modern approach to use the Web as a platform and expose data in a format that can be
easily shared and re-used within a larger network of intereconnected data.

Much like in the nienties we created web pages with links to other pages right now it's about publishing datasets 
that link to each other. The advantage is that right now entire verticals are adopting Linked Data Principles 
to share knowledge within different communities. 

=================
Who is using Linked Data today?
=================

In the media industries companies like BBC or RedBull are investing in these technologies, in the Public Health Care 
the World Health Organisation, in the energy sector companies like Enel. Public Libraries are adopting these 
standards to share materials at regional, national and international level. 

Public administrations around the World are committed to make their data available as Linked Open Data. In more horizontal
markets search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex are starting to use these technologies to increase the 
quality of their services and to become more meanigful.
