**WordLift** brings the power of *Artificial Intelligence* to web publishers around the World.
**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to help you create, structure and visualize your content and to publish it as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ following **Tim Berners-Lee**'s `Linked Data Principles <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`_.

Linked Data is the language machines can read and understand in order to seamlessly analyze content, index it and fetch answers back to users. 
Linked Data technologies allow software agents and search crawlers find, share and integrate information across different resources.

WordLift supports bloggers and site owners building *beautifully structured web sites* and reach their maximum potential audiences:

- It understands the text you write and structures it to allow you to create effective navigation flows and make sure commercial search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex and Yahoo! receive the structured data they need to properly index and rank your content.

- It  enriches your blog posts and pages with facts, links and images, and organizes them in relationship to each other, to internal vocabularies, and to other openly available data sources like DBpedia and Wikidata, increasing your readers’ engagement.

.. note::
        **WordLift** is available to all for a monthly fee. Find out more and get your activation key directly `on our website <https://wordlift.io>`_.

In the Public Health Care the World Health Organisation, in the energy sector companies like Enel. 
Public libraries are adopting these  standards to share content at regional, national and international level. 
Public administrations around the world are committed to make their data available as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_. 
Search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex, as well as social networks like Facebook, use these technologies to increase the quality of their services and to become *more meaningful* to their end users.

=================
Why shall I publish my contents in the form of metadata?
=================
Organising web content around **concepts** or **entities** rather than traditional web pages improves 
*navigation*, *content re-use*, *content re-purposing* and *search engine rankings*, bringing the user experience to a new level of engagement.

As your content metadata is published as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ it becomes easier
for third party applications providers like Google to better understand and interact with your content, creating new entry points and  increasing traffic on your website (more on `Schema.org Actions <http://searchengineland.com/schema-user-actions-now-available-189421>`_ from the Search Engine Land website).

=================
Can you tell me more about WordLift’s SEO benefits?
=================

WordLift allows you to add a layer of metadata to your content, which provides several SEO benefits:

Schema markup added to all your content will ensure Google will properly index and unquestionably understand the content of your article;
Internal linking based on semantic concepts more than anchor texts will increase the SEO value of your pages;
A properly curated vocabulary will act as search magnet on higher traffic queries to be then connected to your blog posts and your pages;
Connecting your content semantically has a terrific effect on engagement metrics as well and good engagement metrics are of course an important signal for Google as well. Thanks to the contextual info added to your content and the connections between pages and posts that can be made through the 5 visualization widgets available, you will enjoy double digit growth for all your usability metrics.
