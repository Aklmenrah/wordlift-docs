**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to create, structure and visualize your content.

**WordLift** is a **content marketing tool** to help content creators build *beautifully structured web sites* and grow their audience. 

**WordLift** publishes content metadata using `Linked Data technlogies <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ and following **Tim Berners-Lee**'s 
`Linked Data Principles <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`_.

Linked Data is the language machines can read and understand in order to seamlessly analyze content, index it and fetch answers back to users. 

Linked Data technologies allow software agents and search crawlers find, share and integrate information across different resources.

**WordLift** understands the text you write and structures it to help you grow the visibility of your content in organic (non-paid) search engine results.

**WordLift** enriches the content of blog posts and pages with **facts, links and images**, tagging, categorising, 
and classifying them in relationship to each other, to internal vocabularies, and to other openly available data sources like DBpedia, Wikidata and the Google Knowledge Graph. By adding contextual information to web content **WordLift** *transforms WordPress into a fully dynamic semantic content management system*. 

.. note::
        **WordLift** is available to all for a monthly fee. Find out more and get your activation key directly `on our website <https://wordlift.io>`_.

=================

Search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex, as well as social networks like Facebook, use these technologies to increase the quality of their services and to become *more meaningful* to their end users.

=================
Why shall I publish my contents in the form of metadata?
=================
Organising web content around **concepts** or **entities** rather than traditional web pages improves 
*navigation*, *content re-use*, *content re-purposing* and *search engine rankings*, bringing the user experience to a new level of engagement.

As your content metadata is published as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ it becomes easier
for third party applications providers like Google to better understand and interact with your content, creating new entry points and  increasing traffic on your website (more on `Schema.org Actions <http://searchengineland.com/schema-user-actions-now-available-189421>`_ from the Search Engine Land website).
