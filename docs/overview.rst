Overview
===============

**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to create, structure and visualize your content.
**WordLift** helps content creators to build *beautifully structured web sites* and to 
publish their content as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ following **Tim Berners-Lee**'s 
`Linked Data Principles <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`_.

WordLift understands the text you write and structures it to allow you to create effective navigation storyboards 
and make sure *commercial search* engines like Google, Bing, Yandex and Yahoo! receive the structured data 
they need to properly index and rank your content.

**WordLift** enriches the content of blog posts and pages with **facts, links and images**, tagging, categorising, 
and classifying them in relationship to each other, to internal vocabularies, and to other openly 
available open data sources like DBpedia and Freebase. 
This means adding contextual information to web content in the form of universal identifier 
to *transform WordPress into a fully dynamic semantic architecture*. 

=================
Who is using metadata publishing systems today?
=================

In the media industries companies like BBC, The Financial Times and Associated Press are investing in these technologies.
In the Public Health Care the World Health Organisation, in the energy sector companies like Enel. 
Public libraries are adopting these  standards to share content at regional, national and international level. 
Public administrations around the world are committed to make their data available as Linked Open Data. 
Search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex, as well as social networks like Facebook, use these technologies to increase the quality of their services and to become *more meaningful* to their end users.

=================
Why shall I publish my contents in the form of metadata?
=================
Organising web content around **concepts** or **entities** rather than traditional web pages improves 
*navigation*, *content re-use*, *content re-purposing* and *search engine rankings*, bringing the user experience to a new level of engagement.

As your content metadata is published as `Linked Open Data <key-concepts.html#linked-open-data>`_ it becomes easier
for third party applications providers like Google to better understand and interact with your content, creating new entry points and  increasing traffic on your website (more on `Schema.org Actions <http://searchengineland.com/schema-user-actions-now-available-189421>`_ from the Search Engine Land website).

=================
Can you tell me more about WordLiftâ€™s SEO benefits?

WordLift allows you to add a layer of metadata to your content, which provides several SEO benefits:

Schema markup added to all your content will ensure Google will properly index and unquestionably understand the content of your article;
Internal linking based on semantic concepts more than anchor texts will increase the SEO value of your pages;
A properly curated vocabulary will act as search magnet on higher traffic queries to be then connected to your blog posts and your pages;
Connecting your content semantically has a terrific effect on engagement metrics as well and good engagement metrics are of course an important signal for Google as well. Thanks to the contextual info added to your content and the connections between pages and posts that can be made through the 5 visualization widgets available, you will enjoy double digit growth for all your usability metrics.
