Overview
===============

**WordLift** is a plugin for WordPress designed to create, structure and visualizing your contents.
**WordLift** helps you **adding facts**, text and media to build *beautifully structured web sites* and to 
publish your content as `Linked Open Data <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_ following **Tim Berners-Lee**'s 
`Linked Data Principles <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html>`_.

Facts allows WordLift to understand the text you write, structure it to create effective navigation storyboards 
and make sure *commercial search* engines like Google, Bing, Yandex and Yahoo! receive  the structured data 
they need to properly index your contents.

**WordLift** enriches the content/context of blog posts and pages by tagging, categorising, 
and/or classifying them in relationship to each other, to existing dictionaries, and/or to other openly 
available reference sources like DBpedia and Freebase. 
This means adding contextual information to web publishing contents in the form of universal identifier 
to *transform WordPress into a fully dynamic semantic architecture*. 

=================
Why shall I publish my contents as Linked Open Data?
=================

Linked Open Data is a modern approach to use the Web as a platform and expose data in a format that can be
easily shared and re-used within a larger network of intereconnected data.

Much like in the nienties we created web pages with links to other pages right now it's about publishing datasets 
that link to each other. The advantage is that right now entire verticals are adopting Linked Data Principles 
to share knowledge within different communities. 

=================
Who is using Linked Data today?
=================

In the media industries companies like BBC, Financial Times and Associated Press are investing in these technologies, in the Public Health Care 
the World Health Organisation, in the energy sector companies like Enel. Public Libraries are adopting these 
standards to share materials at regional, national and international level. 

Public administrations around the World are committed to make their data available as Linked Open Data. In more horizontal
markets search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Yandex as well as social networks like Facebook are starting to use these technologies to increase the 
quality of their services and to become *more meanigful* to their end users.

=================
Why shall I publish my contents as Linked Open Data?
=================
Organising web contents around **concepts** or **entities** rather than traditional web pages helps 
*improve navigation*, *content re-use*, *content re-purposing* and *search engine rankings*.

Overall having content aggregations based on **semantic fingerprinting** (using Linked Data identifiers) creates
a richer navigation bringing the user experience to new levels of engagement.

As your contents metadata is published as `Linked Open Data <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>`_ it becomes easier
for third party applications providers like Google to interact with your contents creating multi-dimensional entry points and 
increasing traffic on your website (more on `Schema.org Actions <http://searchengineland.com/schema-user-actions-now-available-189421>`_ from the Search Engine Land website).

=================
If I add Schema.org markup will I jump on top of the Search results? 
=================

No, Schema.org is worth implementing right now but might have no immediate result on your SERP positionings.
Adding Schema.org does help creating rich snippets for your pages but most importantly itâ€™s about creating content
that machines can understand and reference. 

There are a growing number of services (including Google) that try 
to make use of this kind of information: ensuring that you are *directly* controlling the data you care about is a good thing.
