Publish Entity
_____________

Entities when saved are created as list of articles (index) that refer to that entity. This works just like tags in WordPress (each tag being accessible with a unique URL and presenting the list of articles that use the tag). 

.. note::

	The URL for the entity page being ::
		http://*<name-of-your-WordPress-server>*/?entity=<*name-of-theâ€“entity*>

While this works in most cases some entities might represent significant concepts for your navigation storyboard (i.e. the webpage of an event or a person in your organisation). In these cases we shall transform the entity page from being a pure index of articles into an actual webpage describing the entity.  

This is made possible by choosing between *page* and *index* from the dropdown menu in the publishing panel.
