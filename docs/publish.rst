Publish Entity
_____________

Entities when saved are created as `custom posts` in the local WordPress installation and are accessible from the `WordLift vocabulary <key-concepts.html#vocabulary>`_. 

.. note::

	The URL for an entity page is as follows::
		http://*<name-of-your-WordPress-server>*/?entity=<*name-of-theâ€“entity*>


Metadata being added to Entity pages 
-------------------------------


RDF representation of the Entity 
-------------------------------
By clicking on the **View on Linked Data** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) the **RDF representation of the entity** is displayed using `LodView <http://lodview.it/>`_.

In this example I can see the relation being created between the entity *[Mars]* and the entity *[Solar System]* (``dcterms:relation``). This relation has been created from the `edit entity page <edit-entity.html#linking-other-entities>`_ page by annotating the description of the entity.

I can also see (in this last image using `LodLive <http://lodlive.it/>`_) the `sameAs` attributes.  


Publish Post/Page
_____________
Posts and Pages with **WordLift** are annotated using the `schema.org` vocabulary. 
The *schema markup* is a code (semantic vocabulary) to help search engines return more informative results for their users.

Metadata being added to Post/Page 
-------------------------------
By clicking on the **Test Google Rich Snippets** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) we can see the list of entities being added to the content.

In this example we're telling search engines that this post is relevant for search around the concept of *[Solar System]* (here represented as *Place*).   

RDF representation of the Post/Page 
-------------------------------
By clicking on the **View on Linked Data** button (right after the *Permalink* in the editor) the **RDF representation of the post** is displayed using `LodView <http://lodview.it/>`_.
