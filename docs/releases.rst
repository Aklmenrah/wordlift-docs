WordLift 3.13.2 (2017-07-12) release notes
_____________

The WordLift 3.13.3 release is now available. The biggest news is that you can turn *on* and *off* WordLiftâ€™s analysis (and annotations) anytime you like. Say you are opening an article for a quick typo edit, you can now simply disable WordLift and avoid the analysis to run. Just click on the small arrow on the top-right corner of the WordLiftâ€™s widget. See how it works in the *.gif* below:
