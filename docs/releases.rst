The WordLift 3.18 release is now available. We have introduced the new entity type for `Offer <http://docs.wordlift.io/en/latest/edit-entity.html#edit-a-offer>`_ and the support for the property `performer` on the entity type `Event <http://docs.wordlift.io/en/latest/edit-entity.html#edit-an-event>`_. The `glossary widget <http://docs.wordlift.io/en/latest/discover.html#the-glossary-widget>`_ has also been improved and it now supports a new option to let you display all the entities that belong to a specific WordPress Category. Above all, WordLift's Knowledge Graph got better ðŸ˜‰ the plugin now stores in RDF the link between entities and articles.
